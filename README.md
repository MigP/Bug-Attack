## 3. Game play

It's a very hot day and you are desperate for a swim in the fresh water of the river on the other side of the road. You have to cross the road and avoid the killer bugs racing across it. If they get you, you lose precious health and are thrown back to your starting location. To make things worse, you'll be running against a clock, and as soon as that timer reaches zero, you will lose one life.
Lose enough health and you end up losing one of your lives. To spice it up, random bonuses appear out of nowhere on the middle of the road for you to catch. Three kinds of gemstones. A blue one, and the most common, will give you a mere 5 points. A green one, a little less common, will give you 10 points. And an orange one, which will give you 20 points. There are also bonuses that will give you 10 extra time units, but these are rarer. Rarer still are the stars, which will fully restore your health. But the rarest bonus of all is the heart, which gives you an extra life.
Despite all these obstacles, you are desperate for that river, and each time you reach it you get 50 points. It's just a shame that once you do, you'll be catapulted back to the other side of the road again.
Good luck on your quest. And keep in mind that the more points you get the more difficult it will get to cross that road.
